/**

""" --- Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math ---

The elves are running low on wrapping paper,
and so they need to submit an order for more.
They have a list of the dimensions (length l, width w, and height h)
of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.

Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect right rectangular prism),
which makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each
gift a little easier: find the surface area of the box,
which is 2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l.
The elves also need a little extra paper for each present:
the area of the smallest side.

For example:

A present with dimensions 2x3x4 requires
2*6 + 2*12 + 2*8 = 52 square feet of wrapping paper
plus 6 square feet of slack, for a total of 58 square feet.
A present with dimensions 1x1x10 requires
2*1 + 2*10 + 2*10 = 42 square feet of wrapping paper
plus 1 square foot of slack, for a total of 43 square feet.
All numbers in the elves' list are in feet.
How many total square feet of wrapping paper should they order?
