# Advent of Code

website: [http://adventofcode.com](http://adventofcode.com)

Santa was hoping for a white Christmas,
but his weather machine's "snow" function
is powered by stars, and he's fresh out!
To save Christmas,
he needs you to collect fifty stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles.
Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the advent calendar;
the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.
Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

## Repo structure

Solutions for each day are stored in separate folders marked by day numbers. For e.g. the solution for day 1 is in **day01**, with the files titled by the name of the puzzle. In case a puzzle has multiple parts, the solution is separated across different files, appended by the part number. For e.g. the solution for the puzzle 'some_puzzle' is in the file _some_puzzle.ext_ and it's second part is in the file _some_puzzle_part_2.ext_.

## Languages

I'm going to try and implement solutions in as many languages as I can. Here's a list (ambition) of languages I would like to develop in:

 - python3 (primary)
 - C (clang-700.1.81)
 - C++ (clang-700.1.81)
 - Java
 - C#
 - Javascript
 - Swift

### Future work

As I take the fancy, I'll learn some language and solve these puzzles for fun (and learning), and will update the repo with their solutions.

## Program structure

Each program starts off with reading the input which is stored in the same folder as the program file with the name _input.txt_. All readings of this file will be immutable.
