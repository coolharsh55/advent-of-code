# Advent of Code

My solutions to the Advent of Code holiday puzzles.

## Repo structure

The submissions are sepearated by years. For 2016, I have used the ipynb files stored in the python3 folder. For 2015, the submissions are in separate folders based on days.

## Languages

Ideally, the submissions are only going to be in python. I'm going to try and implement solutions in as many languages as I can. Here's a list (ambition) of languages I would like to develop in:

 - python3 (primary)
 - LISP/Scheme
 - Haskell
 - Smalltalk/ML
 - C
 - Java/C#
 - Javascript

### Future work

As I take the fancy, I'll learn some language and solve these puzzles for fun (and learning), and will update the repo with their solutions.

## Program structure

Each program starts off with reading the input which is stored in the same folder as the program file with the name _input.txt_. All readings of this file will be immutable.
