    "Something is jamming your communications with Santa. Fortunately, your signal is only partially jammed, and protocol in situations like this is to switch to a [simple repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_code) code to get the message through.\n",

We'll simply use the `Counter` from `collections`, which I've described in a previous puzzle. We need counters for each position in the input. We're making a few assumptions here:\n",

    "To create the appropriate number of counters, we inspect the first line and then create as many counters as its length, and store them in a list. This way, we can match the specific index of the counter with the index in the string. To get the most common element from the counter, we use the `most_common(n)` method, which returns `n` most common elements (we want only 1).\n",
