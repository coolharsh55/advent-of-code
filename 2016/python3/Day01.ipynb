    "iteration, whether we have been to that point.\n",
    "The naive solution would be to store every point we visit, so it merely\n",
    "becomes a problem of sifting through searches (binary search would suffice).\n",
    "But to make it more efficient, we only store the **paths**,\n",

    "### Basic Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the property of points lying on a line segment. Suppose we have the\n",
    "line segment `AB`, and a point `P` lies on the line, then the sum of the\n",
    "distance of `P` from `A` and `P` to `B`\n",

    "point does lie on the line, then one of the axis co-ordinates will be the\n",
    "same in all three points `(A, B, C)`. This is true in this case because all\n",
