    "You're trying to access a secure vault protected by a `4x4` grid of small rooms connected by doors. You start in the top-left room (marked `S`), and you can access the vault (marked `V`) once you reach the bottom-right room:\n",

    "    #-#-#-#-#\n",
    "    # | | | #\n",

    "    # | | | #\n",
    "    #-#-#-#-#\n",
    "    # | | |  \n",
    "    ####### V\n",
    "    \n",
    "Fixed walls are marked with `#`, and doors are marked with `-` or `|`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The doors in your current room are either open or closed (and locked) based on the hexadecimal `MD5` hash of a passcode (your puzzle input) followed by a sequence of uppercase characters representing the path you have taken so far (`U for up, D for down, L for left, and R for right`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the first four characters of the hash are used; they represent, respectively, the doors up, down, left, and right from your current position. Any `b, c, d, e, or f` means that the corresponding door is open; any other character (`any number or a`) means that the corresponding door is closed and locked.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the vault, all you need to do is reach the bottom-right room; reaching this room opens the vault and all doors in the maze.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose the passcode is `hijkl`. Initially, you have taken no steps, and so your path is empty: you simply find the MD5 hash of `hijkl` alone. The first four characters of this hash are `ced9`, which indicate that up is open (c), down is open (e), left is open (d), and right is closed and locked (9). Because you start in the top-left corner, there are no \"up\" or \"left\" doors to be open, so your only choice is down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, having gone only one step (down, or D), you find the hash of `hijklD`. This produces `f2bc`, which indicates that you can go back up, left (but that's a wall), or right. Going right means hashing `hijklDR` to get `5745` - all doors closed and locked. However, going up instead is worthwhile: even though it returns you to the room you started in, your path would then be DU, opening a different set of doors.\n",
    "\n",
    "After going `DU` (and then hashing `hijklDU` to get `528e`), only the right door is open; after going `DUR`, all doors lock. (Fortunately, your actual passcode is not hijkl).\n",
    "\n",
    "Passcodes actually used by Easter Bunny Vault Security do allow access to the vault if you know the right path. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    " - If your passcode were `ihgpwlah`, the shortest path would be `DDRRRD`.\n",
    " - With `kglvqrro`, the shortest path would be `DDUDRLRRUDRD`.\n",
    " - With `ulqzkmiv`, the shortest would be `DRURDRUDDLLDLUURRDULRLDUUDDDRR`.\n",

    "### Solution logic\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite similar to Day 13, where we had to find a short path through the maze. This time around, whether the next point is valid or not (its door is open or closed) depends on the path taken to reach there (so like life!).\n",
    "\n",
    "At any point, whether the doors are open or not is dependant on the path taken to reach that room. In specific, the MD5 checksum of the input string suffixed by the path - as directions abbreviated:\n",
    "\n",
    "    U    UP\n",
    "    D    DOWN\n",
    "    L    LEFT\n",
    "    R    RIGHT\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the strategy to solve this must be the same as that used on Day 13, where we use a queue to store the paths we have traversed. There is a case that must be stated before we begin - this time, if we move back to a previous point, the doors that are open might change as the path itself has changed. So instead of a queue, we'll use a priority heap to store that paths and work only on those paths that have not been iterated yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The priority will be the length of the path - this way, the agorithm will try to iterate over all the shorter paths first - of do a BFS (breadth-first-search). Another option to use instead of a heap is to use a sorted list. Python has the `bisect` module that can maintain a sorted list.\n",

    " - initialize priority heap with the starting state\n",
    " - while heap has states:\n",
    "     - pop state <-- this will be the one with the most 'priority'\n",
    "     - check if state is end state:\n",
    "         - if yes, print answer and exit \n",
    "     - get all open doors:\n",
    "         - if next point is not valid, discard it\n",
    "         - append the direction to the current path\n",
