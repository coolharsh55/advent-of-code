    "Wandering around a secure area, you come across a datalink port to a new part of the network. After briefly scanning it for interesting files, you find one file in particular that catches your attention. It's compressed with an experimental format, but fortunately, the documentation for the format is nearby.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format compresses a sequence of characters. Whitespace is ignored. To indicate that some sequence should be repeated, a marker is added to the file, like `(10x2)`. To decompress this marker, take the subsequent `10` characters and repeat them `2` times. Then, continue reading the file _after_ the repeated data. The marker itself is not included in the decompressed output.\n",
    "\n",
    "If parentheses or other characters appear within the data referenced by a marker, that's okay - treat it like normal data, not a marker, and then resume looking for markers after the decompressed section.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `ADVENT` contains no markers and decompresses to itself with no changes, resulting in a decompressed length of `6`.\n",
    " - `A(1x5)BC` repeats only the `B` a total of `5` times, becoming `ABBBBBC` for a decompressed length of `7`.\n",
    " - `(3x3)XYZ` becomes `XYZXYZXYZ` for a decompressed length of `9`.\n",
    " - `A(2x2)BCD(2x2)EFG` doubles the `BC` and `EF`, becoming `ABCBCDEFEFG` for a decompressed length of `11`.\n",
    " - `(6x1)(1x3)A` simply becomes `(1x3)A` - the `(1x3)` looks like a marker, but because it's within a data section of another marker, it is not treated any differently from the `A` that comes after it. It has a decompressed length of `6`.\n",
    " - `X(8x2)(3x3)ABCY` becomes `X(3x3)ABC(3x3)ABCY` (for a decompressed length of `18`), because the decompressed data from the `(8x2)` marker (the `(3x3)ABC)` is skipped and not processed further.\n",

    "\n",
    "Any time we encounter brackets of the format `(AxB)`, we take in the next `A` characters regardless of what they are, and repeat them `B` times in the decompressed data. There are a few points to note here:\n",
    "\n",
    " - If any of the `A` characters contain bracket(s), they are to be ignored and treated as normal characters\n",
    " - Brackets of other formats could be present in the input. For e.g. `()`, `(A)`, `(AxBxC)`, etc. These are to be ignored and not considered as markers.\n",
    " - Whitespace is to be ignored. So any newlines, spaces, tabs, etc. are ignored and not parsed.\n",
    " \n",
    "We iterate over each character at a time, and check if it is a start of the marker (bracket). If it is, we skip the next `A` characters, and add `A * B` to the count. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we only need to count the length of the decompressed data, we do not need to actually store it. We can simply use a `count` variable to hold the count of the decompressed characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a function called `parse_marker` to get the values of `A` and `B` from the marker and to calculate the decompressed length. If the start of the sequence is not a `(`, it is a single character with the decompressed length of `1`. If the character is `(`, it is a marker and we extract the values and count the decompressed length as `A x B`."
