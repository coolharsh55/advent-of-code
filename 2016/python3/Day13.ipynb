    "You arrive at the first floor of this new building to discover a much less welcoming environment than the shiny atrium of the last one. Instead, you are in a maze of twisty little cubicles, all alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every location in this area is addressed by a pair of non-negative integers `(x,y)`. Each such coordinate is either a wall or an open space. You can't move diagonally. The cube maze starts at `0,0` and seems to extend infinitely toward positive `x` and `y`; negative values are invalid, as they represent a location outside the building. You are in a small waiting area at `1,1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it seems chaotic, a nearby morale-boosting poster explains, the layout is actually quite logical. You can determine whether a given x,y coordinate will be a wall or an open space using a simple system:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Find `x*x + 3*x + 2*x*y + y + y*y`.\n",
    " - Add the office designer's favorite number (your puzzle input).\n",
    " - Find the _binary_ representation of that sum; count the number of `bits` that are `1`.\n",
    "        - If the number of bits that are 1 is `even`, it's an _open_ space.\n",
    "        - If the number of bits that are 1 is `odd`, it's a _wall_.\n",
    "        \n",
    "For example, if the office designer's favorite number were `10`, drawing walls as `#` and open spaces as `.`, the corner of the building containing `0,0` would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "      0123456789\n",

    "    4 .##..#..#.\n",
    "    5 ..##....#.\n",
    "    6 #...##.###\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now, suppose you wanted to reach `7,4`. The shortest route you could take is marked as `O`:\n",
    "\n",
    "      0123456789\n",
    "    0 .#.####.##\n",

    "    5 ..##OOO.#.\n",
    "    6 #...##.###\n",
    "    \n",

In this approach, we identify all possible directions we can currently move in and put them in the queue. Then while the stack is not empty, we pop a move out, and repeat the directions it can take and so on until we reach the end-point, at which, we store the length of the path we took.\n",

    "To store the length of the path, each move put on the stack must have an accompanying `count` of the steps it took to reach there. It is possible to apply heuristic by storing an index of paths sorted by the length and giving priority to pursuing paths with a shorter length first, or those that are nearer to the end-point.\n",
    "\n",
    "One very important thing to note: we must not travel to the same point again - otherwise we'll keep chasing our own tails in recursive cycles (or an infinite while loop, take your pick). To prevent that, we have to maintain an index of points we have already traversed. We use a `dictionary` to hold this index, which stores the number of steps we took to traverse to this point. If there comes a move that reaches the same point in lesser number of steps, we know that it is a shorter route, and we continue traversing it. If the move has more number of steps to reach the same point, then it is not an optimum path, and do not need to continue along it."
